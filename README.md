# FantasyFootball
A repo containing various analyses and scripts I use for fantasy football. Most generally applicable to me, but could be useful to others as well.
I am making heavy use of R, and specific R libraries like the tidyverse suite, nflFastR, and ffverse suite of packages. The NFL related packages make for easy data
collection of NFL data. Allowing me to focus on specific analyses instead of scraping data. Again, this is likely just helpful for me, but hopefully others can find
inspiration as well.
